# Celery "Pending" Task Fix

## Problem Summary
Group assignment tasks were getting stuck on "pending" status, preventing any behavior execution from completing.

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Celery Worker Not Running**
**Issue**: No Celery workers were running to process tasks
**Solution**: Started Celery worker with: `celery -A services.celery_tasks.celery_app worker --loglevel=info`

### 2. ❌ **Database Session Context Manager Error**
**Issue**: `'generator' object does not support the context manager protocol`
**Root Cause**: `get_session()` in `database.py` returns a generator (for FastAPI dependency injection), but Celery tasks need direct session management
**Solution**: Updated Celery tasks to use `Session(engine)` directly instead of `get_session()`

```python
# Before (broken):
with get_session() as db:

# After (fixed):
with Session(engine) as db:
```

### 3. ❌ **Page Deployment Not Found in Memory**
**Issue**: `Page deployment {id} not found in memory`
**Root Cause**: Page deployments are stored in `ACTIVE_PAGE_DEPLOYMENTS` in the main application memory, but Celery worker processes run in separate memory spaces
**Solution**: Added fallback logic to load deployments from database when not found in memory

```python
# Get the page deployment from memory, or load it if not found
deployment_info = get_active_page_deployment(deployment_id)
if not deployment_info:
    # Load from database using async function
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    loaded = loop.run_until_complete(load_page_deployment_on_demand(deployment_id, executed_by_user_id, db))
    deployment_info = get_active_page_deployment(deployment_id)
```

## Files Modified
1. **`backend/services/celery_tasks.py`**:
   - Fixed database session handling
   - Added deployment loading from database
   - Enhanced error handling

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed**: Celery worker is running
✅ **Fixed**: Database session context manager issue
✅ **Fixed**: Page deployment memory issue
✅ **Ready**: Tasks should now progress from "pending" to execution

## Testing
The system is now ready to handle group assignment and theme creation tasks. When you trigger a behavior execution:

1. Task will be queued and picked up by Celery worker
2. Database session will be created properly
3. Page deployment will be loaded from database if not in memory
4. Behavior will execute with progress tracking
5. Results will be returned to frontend

## Next Steps
- Test a real group assignment behavior execution
- Monitor Celery worker logs for any remaining issues
- Verify progress updates are working correctly in frontend
